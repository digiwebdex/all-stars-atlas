# Changelog — Seven Trip

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [4.2.0] — 2026-04-06 — Wallet-Centric Finance System & Ticket Issue Requests

### Added — Wallet-Centric Payment Architecture
- **Wallet as single payment source**: Users deposit funds (bank transfer with receipt upload, SSLCommerz, bKash, Nagad), then pay bookings from wallet balance
- **Issue With Balance**: One-click wallet payment on any Reserved/Pending/Confirmed booking → deducts wallet balance + auto-creates Ticket Issue Request for admin
- **Atomic wallet transactions**: `/dashboard/wallet/pay` uses MySQL transaction with `FOR UPDATE` row locking — debit, booking update, and ticket request creation all succeed or all rollback
- **Bank transfer deposit**: User selects admin-configured bank account from searchable dropdown (synced from Admin Settings), sees account details (A/C Name, Number, Branch, Routing) with copy-to-clipboard, uploads payment receipt
- **Ticket Issue Request flow**: `POST /dashboard/ticket-issue-request` auto-created inside wallet/pay transaction; admin sees requests in `/admin/ticket-issue-requests` with Approve & Issue Ticket button
- **Admin ticket issuance popup**: Shows PNR, ticket number (auto-filled or editable), triggers GDS ticketing (Sabre/BDFare/FlyHub/TTI) on confirm
- **Admin booking detail 9-tab interface**: Itinerary, Passengers, Fare Breakdown, Invoice, Activity, Debug, Supplier, Terminal (GDS command window using `SabreCommandLLSRQ`), Actions
- **Approve & Issue Ticket visibility guard**: Button only appears when booking `payment_status = 'paid'` (i.e., user paid via wallet)
- **DashboardIssueWithBalance page**: Dedicated page listing all payable bookings with wallet balance, one-click pay

### Added — New Database Tables
- `wallet` — Per-user balance table (authoritative source of truth)
- `wallet_transactions` — Wallet credit/debit audit log
- `ticket_issue_requests` — Tracks ticket issue lifecycle (pending → processing → issued/rejected)

### Added — New API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/dashboard/wallet/pay` | User | Atomic: deduct wallet + update booking + create ticket issue request |
| `POST` | `/dashboard/wallet/deposit` | User | Request deposit (bank transfer with receipt, pending admin approval) |
| `POST` | `/dashboard/wallet/transfer` | User | Transfer balance to another user |
| `POST` | `/dashboard/ticket-issue-request` | User | Manual ticket issue request (also auto-created by wallet/pay) |
| `GET` | `/dashboard/ticket-issue-requests` | User | List user's own ticket issue requests |
| `GET` | `/admin/ticket-issue-requests` | Admin | List all pending/processing ticket requests |
| `PUT` | `/admin/ticket-issue-requests/:id` | Admin | Process request (issue via GDS or reject) |

### Fixed — Wallet Balance
- **Derived balance fallback**: If `wallet` table is missing or empty, balance derived from approved transaction history (`totalCredited - totalDebited`)
- **`syncWalletFromDerivedBalance()`**: Auto-syncs derived balance into wallet table when wallet row is stale
- **`getEffectiveWalletState()`**: Returns `effectiveBalance` = max(walletBalance, derivedBalance) for robust display
- **Payment approval wallet credit**: Admin approving a deposit now correctly credits user's wallet via `UPDATE wallet SET balance = balance + ?` with INSERT fallback
- **Transaction running balance**: Account Ledger computes running balance from newest→oldest with signed amounts

### Fixed — Issue With Balance Transaction Atomicity
- **🔴 Bug**: `/dashboard/wallet/pay` was failing with "Payment failed" because the wallet deduction, booking update, and ticket request creation were separate non-transactional calls
- **Fix**: Wrapped entire flow in MySQL transaction with `conn.beginTransaction()` / `conn.commit()` / `conn.rollback()` and `FOR UPDATE` row lock on booking
- **Fix**: Ticket issue request now created inside the same transaction (not as a separate frontend call)
- **Fix**: Duplicate payment guard — rejects if `payment_status` already `'paid'` or if an open ticket request exists

### Changed — Dashboard
- **Removed**: "Send Payment Request" concept — replaced by wallet deposit + Issue With Balance
- **Wallet page**: Bank account selection changed from static list to searchable dropdown with details shown on selection
- **Booking Detail**: "Issue With Balance" button with popup showing wallet balance, booking details, after-payment balance
- **Sabre Terminal**: Upgraded `SabreCommandLLSRQ` from deprecated v1.8.1 to v2.0.0+

## [4.1.6] — 2026-03-17 — Dashboard Hardening & E-Ticket PDF Fix

### Fixed — E-Ticket PDF Garbled Characters
- **ASCII-safe PDF rendering**: Replaced all non-Latin-1 Unicode characters (emojis, Bengali Taka `৳`, arrows) with ASCII alternatives
- Timeline icons: `🏢🧳🔒🚶` → `[1] [2] [3] [4]` numbered indicators
- Currency: `৳` → `BDT` throughout invoices and receipts
- Directional icons: `◄►→` → `<< >> -`

### Fixed — Flight Status Badge
- **Graceful error handling** for empty or malformed Sabre FLIFO responses
- Handles JSON parse failures and empty data states without crashing
- User-friendly "not available for this route" messages when data is unavailable

### Fixed — Fare Rules Modal
- **Airline code duplication fix**: Title no longer shows `WYWY318` — now correctly displays `WY318`
- `cleanFlightNum()` utility strips airline prefix before display and API calls
- Handles empty response objects gracefully with clean fallback messages

### Fixed — Sabre API Resilience
- `sabreRequest()` in `sabre-flights.js` now handles empty or non-JSON responses from Sabre API
- Prevents "Unexpected end of JSON input" crashes on malformed GDS responses

### Verified — All 15+ Dashboard Modules
- Bookings, Wallet, E-Tickets, Transactions, Travellers, Payments, SSR History, Search History, Settings, Wishlist, Rewards, Invoices, Reports, Support Tickets, Pay Later — all API-connected and functional

---

## [4.1.5] — 2026-03-17 — Cabin Class Accuracy & Branded Fare Naming

### Fixed — Cabin Class Display
- **Card cabin label** now derives the correct cabin from the GDS booking class letter (e.g., J → "Business - J Class" instead of "Economy - J Class")
- Mapping: `C/J/D/I/Z` → Business, `F/A/P/R` → First, `W/E` → Premium Economy, all others → Economy
- This is the GDS truth — no client-side overriding of API data

### Added — Branded Fare Naming
- Fare variants in "View Round-Trip Prices" now display branded names (e.g., "Economy Convenience", "Business Saver") instead of generic "Fare Option 1/2/3"
- `deriveFareBrandName()` utility maps booking class letters to meaningful tier names
- Searched cabin class fares are sorted first; other cabin upsells/downsells shown after

### Added — Cabin Class Guide
- Informational banner on flight results page explaining cabin classes and booking codes
- Helps users understand what V, H, J, C, F class letters mean

---

## [4.1.4] — 2026-03-15 — Quick-Sort Filters Fix (Cheapest/Fastest/Best)

### Fixed — Quick-Sort Filters
- **Cheapest/Fastest/Best** top filter chips now correctly re-sort the flight list on click
- Sorting uses `pairPayable()` (Base Fare − Discount + Tax + AIT VAT) for price consistency with displayed card prices
- Round-trip pairs sorted via dedicated `sortRoundTripPairs()` with total journey duration (outbound + return)
- Deterministic tie-breakers: departure timestamp → stable flight ID to prevent identical-metric flickering
- "Best" algorithm uses weighted score: 40% price spread, 45% duration spread, 15% stops
- `quickSortSummary` chips now compute from `filteredPairs`/`filteredAll` so values update with active filters

---

## [4.1.3] — 2026-03-15 — Flight UI Fixes + TTI Payload Docs + Documentation Overhaul

### Added — TTI/Air Astra Payload Reference
- **TTI_PAYLOADS.md**: Complete production-verified payload reference for Air Astra (TTI/ZENITH) — search, booking, cancel, void, ticketing with exact JSON examples
- Mirrors SABRE_PAYLOADS.md structure for consistency

### Fixed — Flight Results UI
- **Sorting**: Cheapest/Fastest/Best sort now works correctly with robust duration parsing and deterministic tie-breakers
- **Responsiveness**: Flight cards fully responsive across mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1366px+)
- **Filter consistency**: Sidebar time filters and airline stats use airport local time instead of browser time

### Updated — All 20+ Documentation Files
- Version bumped from v4.1.0/v4.1.1 → v4.1.3 across all .md files
- Updated dates to 2026-03-15

---

## [4.1.1] — 2026-03-14 — 100% Production Probe Verified + Documentation Overhaul

### Verified — Full Automated Production Probe (10/10 Tests Passed)
- **34 assertions, 29 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped** (non-critical feature tests)
- **Sabre**: 5 booking scenarios — 1 ADT, ADT+CHD, 2 ADT, ADT+CHD+INF+SSR, Round-Trip — all PNRs created and cancelled
- **TTI**: 5 booking scenarios — 1 ADT, ADT+CHD, ADT+CHD+INF+WCHR, Round-Trip, ADT+CHD — all PNRs created and cancelled
- **PNRs verified**: DXGDPD, KIIRIF, KFGUNO, KLQPYW, LQRTND (Sabre) | 00KTUN, 00KTUP, 00KTUQ, 00KTUS (TTI)
- **Dual PNR extraction**: GDS PNR + Airline PNR confirmed (e.g., DXGDPD + FQAHDU)

### Added — Flight Results UI Enhancement
- **Elegant pill badges** for baggage, seats, cabin class, and refund status on all flight cards
- **Dynamic seat urgency coloring**: >9 seats (green), 5-9 (orange), ≤4 (red)
- **Button-style route labels**: Outbound (accent), Return (amber), Multi-City (blue) with Plane icons
- **Consistent styling** across one-way, round-trip, multi-city cards and booking flow

### Updated — Complete Documentation Overhaul
- **SABRE_FEATURE_AUDIT.md**: Atom-by-atom technical detail for all 10 probe tests with exact payloads, response fields, and PNR evidence
- **SABRE_PAYLOADS.md**: Added TTI payload reference (booking, cancel, response fields), expanded endpoint table with all 18 Sabre operations + 5 TTI operations
- **All .md files**: Updated to v4.1.1 with full probe results and technical specifications

---

## [4.1.0] — 2026-03-14 — UI/UX Overhaul: Search Widget, Flight Arc, Sabre Child/Infant PTC

### Changed — Frontend
- **SearchWidget refactored** with `flightOnly`, `initialFlightValues`, and `compact` props for reuse on results page
- **Flight results modification bar** rebuilt as compact pill bar with full-feature popovers (Domestic/Intl toggle, fare type, preferred airline, cabin class)
- **AnimatedFlightArc** redesigned: animated `›››› ✈ ››››` chevrons (departure=royal blue, return=purple) with custom plane SVG path
- **Date picker auto-close** on flight results: selecting a date immediately triggers new search (one-way) or closes after both dates (round-trip)
- **SearchWidget icons** updated: PlaneTakeoff (From), PlaneLanding (To), Repeat2 (Swap), CalendarDays (Date), Armchair (Cabin), UserRound (Travelers), SendHorizontal (Search)

### Fixed — Backend
- **Sabre child/infant PTC codes**: Children now use age-based `C05`–`C11` codes (from DOB); infants include `Infant: { Ind: true, DateOfBirth }` per Sabre v2.4.0 schema
- **Sabre NumberInParty**: Excludes infants (lap infants don't get seats), preventing overbooking
- **Session timeout redirect**: 20-min timer expiry now auto-redirects to `/flights?from=...&to=...` preserving search params

### Result
- Consistent UI across all search modes (one-way, round-trip, multi-city, domestic, international)
- Compact results-page search bar with all homepage features accessible via popovers

---

## [4.0.0] — 2026-03-14 — Full Sabre GDS Coverage: All 26 Features Implemented

### Added — 10 New API Endpoints
- **Section 24: Void Tickets** — `POST /flights/void` → Sabre `POST /v1/trip/orders/voidFlightTickets` (by PNR or ticket numbers)
- **Section 23: Refund Pricing** — `POST /flights/refund/price` → Sabre `POST /v1/offers/refund/price` (get refund quote)
- **Section 23: Refund Fulfill** — `POST /flights/refund/fulfill` → Sabre `POST /v1/offers/refund/fulfill` (execute refund)
- **Section 22: Exchange/Reissue** — `POST /flights/exchange` → Sabre SOAP `ExchangeBookingRQ v1.1.0` (date change without cancel+rebook)
- **Section 20: Structured Fare Rules** — `GET /flights/fare-rules` → Sabre SOAP `StructureFareRulesRQ v3.0.1` (penalty/rules parsing)
- **Section 25: Flight Status (FLIFO)** — `GET /flights/status` → Sabre `GET /products/air/flight/status`
- **Section 17: Stateless Ancillaries** — `POST /flights/ancillaries-stateless` → Sabre `POST /v1/offers/getAncillaries` (payload/PNR modes)
- **Section 18: Add Ancillary Stateless** — `POST /flights/add-ancillary-stateless` → Sabre `POST /v1/offers/addAncillaries`
- **Section 18: EMD/Fulfill Tickets** — `POST /flights/fulfill-tickets` → Sabre `POST /v1/trip/orders/fulfillOrder`
- **Section 26: Post-booking FF Update** — `POST /flights/update-frequent-flyer` → Sabre UpdatePNR v2.4.0 with FQTV SSR

### Added — Backend Functions
- `sabre-flights.js`: `voidTickets()`, `refundPrice()`, `refundFulfill()`, `getFlightStatus()`, `getAncillariesStateless()`, `addAncillaryStateless()`, `fulfillTickets()`, `updateFrequentFlyer()`
- `sabre-soap.js`: `getStructuredFareRules()`, `exchangeBooking()`

### Result
- **All 26 Sabre GDS sections fully implemented** — 100% feature coverage
- Total API endpoints: 100+
- Total backend route files: 25

## [3.9.9.9] — 2026-03-13 — Sabre Cancel Hardening: SOAP Session Management + Host TA Recovery

### Fixed
- **Sabre cancel Host TA exhaustion**: Diagnosed and resolved "You have reached the limit of Host TAs allocated to you" error that blocked all SOAP-based cancellations
- **SOAP session lifecycle**: Added `resetSoapSessionCacheWithClose()` that properly closes stale sessions before creating new ones, preventing TA pool leaks
- **SOAP retry scope**: Seat map and cancel SOAP retries now only trigger on session/auth/network errors (regex-matched), preventing unnecessary retries on legitimate application errors that waste TA slots
- **Cancel PNR resolution**: Added `resolveCancelLocators()` helper ensuring cancellation always uses the GDS PNR (not airline PNR) — verified PNR AQDAMJ cancelled successfully with airline PNR FDDPE6 intact
- **Cancel safety guard**: Local booking status only transitions to "cancelled" when GDS confirms — blocks phantom cancellations when no valid GDS PNR exists

### Verified
- PNR AQDAMJ (Airlines PNR FDDPE6) — cancelled successfully via SOAP after TA pool recovery
- SOAP diagnostic endpoint confirms session creation working: `sabre-soap-diagnostic` returns `seatMap.success: true`
- REST cancel still returns 403 NOT_AUTHORIZED (PCC J4YL lacks REST cancel privileges — SOAP is primary cancel method)

---

## [3.9.9.8] — 2026-03-13 — Dual PNR Display (Booking ID + Airlines PNR) Across All Dashboards & PDF

### Added
- **Dual PNR display system**: GDS PNR shown as "Booking ID", Airline PNR shown as "Airlines PNR" across all user-facing and admin interfaces
- **User Dashboard Bookings**: PNR column shows Airlines PNR prominently with accent styling, Booking ID as secondary mono text
- **User Dashboard Booking Detail**: Dedicated "Airlines PNR" and "Booking ID" fields in booking info card with copy-friendly styling
- **Admin Dashboard Bookings**: Both PNRs visible in booking table and detail modal
- **E-Ticket PDF**: Separate "BOOKING ID" and "AIRLINES PNR" sections in ticket header with distinct styling
- **Post-Booking Confirmation**: FlightBooking success screen shows both Booking ID and Airlines PNR
- **Booking Confirmation Page**: Both PNR fields passed through to PDF download and display
- **Dashboard Tickets**: Airlines PNR passed to PDF generator for e-ticket downloads

### Changed
- All PNR display logic standardized: `airlinePnr` = real airline confirmation (e.g., `09HUGY`), `gdsBookingId/pnr` = GDS record locator (e.g., `GCCVGK`)
- PDF generator accepts `airlinePnr` as separate field; renders distinct from `gdsPnr`/`bookingRef`
- Removed old fallback logic where GDS PNR was shown as "Airline PNR" — now correctly separated

### Verified
- Sabre booking: GDS PNR `GCCVGK` + Airlines PNR `09HUGY` — both extracted and displayed correctly
- DOCS upload working: passport/visa document upload with OCR/MRZ verification functional
- Title format: `MST RAFIZA MS` (title at end) accepted by Sabre without errors

---

## [3.9.9.7] — 2026-03-13 — Sabre DOCS Strict Mode + Airline PNR from CreatePNR + Ticketlagbe Reference

### Added
- **DOCS strict mode**: When passport DOCS are present in AdvancePassenger, the `no_special_req` fallback variant is disabled — booking MUST succeed with DOCS or fail explicitly, preventing silent PNR creation without passport data in GDS
- **Airline PNR extraction from CreatePNR response**: `extractDistinctSabreAirlinePnr()` now runs immediately on the CreatePNR response before falling back to GetBooking, matching how Ticketlagbe extracts `airlinesPNR` directly from booking result
- **Smart passport field resolution**: New logic detects if `passport` field contains a file path (e.g., `traveller/passport/xxx.jpg`) vs actual passport number, checking `passportNumber`, `passportNo`, `documentNumber`, `travelDocumentNumber` fields in priority order
- **Extended field alias support**: Sabre payload now maps `prefix` → `title`, `passportEx` → `passportExpiry`, `nationalityCountry` → `nationality`, `contactPhone`/`contactEmail` in contact info, `givenName`/`surname` as name fallbacks
- **Enhanced vendor locator regex**: Deep scan for airline PNR now includes `reservationNumber` and `confirmationNumber` keys across CreatePNR, GetBooking, and flights.js extractors

### Changed
- `createBooking()` return object now includes `airlinePnr` and `createVariant` fields
- flights.js Sabre booking block: uses `gdsBookingResult.airlinePnr` first, falls back to GetBooking only when not found in CreatePNR response
- Nationality extraction hardened: strips non-alpha characters, validates 2-letter code, defaults to `BD`

### Fixed
- **Passport field misidentification**: Previously `pax.passport` containing a file upload path (`traveller/passport/xxx.jpg`) was treated as a passport number, causing invalid DOCS SSR — now detected and skipped with warning log
- **AreaCityCode validation error**: Removed `AreaCityCode` from `ContactNumber` payload (Sabre schema rejection)

### Reference
- Analyzed Ticketlagbe HAR (`combined-air-booking` endpoint) to confirm their frontend sends `prefix, firstName, lastName, gender, dateOfBirth, nationalityCountry, passportNo, passportEx, phone, email` — backend handles all Sabre DOCS/SSR injection server-side
- Ticketlagbe response confirms airline PNR (`airlinesPNR: "FBI86I"`) returned directly in booking response alongside GDS PNR (`pnr: "OHKTDQ"`)

---

## [3.9.9.6] — 2026-03-13 — Passport DOCS SSR for Sabre + TTI + Frontend Mandatory Validation

### Added
- **Mandatory passport fields for all flights**: Frontend now requires Passport Number and Expiry Date for both domestic and international bookings
- **Sabre DOCS SSR enforcement**: `advancePassenger` Document object includes `Number`, `ExpirationDate`, `DateOfBirth`, `Gender`, `GivenName`, `Surname` — all mandatory uppercase fields
- **TTI passport injection**: `PassportNumber`, `PassportExpiry`, `DocumentInfo` passed in CreateBooking payload for Air Astra and other TTI carriers
- **Backend field normalization**: `flights.js` normalizer maps `passport` → `passportNumber`, `dob` → `dateOfBirth` ensuring consistent field names across all GDS providers

### Changed
- Frontend booking form no longer conditionally hides passport fields — always visible and required
- Backend logs passport data presence per passenger for debugging

---

## [3.9.9.5] — 2026-03-13 — Production Sabre + 30-Route Booking Test Suite + Dual PNR

### Added
- **30-route comprehensive booking test suite** (`backend/test-bookings.sh`): Tests one-way, round-trip, multi-city, domestic, international, business class, connecting flights, and multi-passenger bookings (adults + children + infants) with full passport data
- **`gdsError` field in booking response**: When Sabre/TTI GDS booking fails, the exact error reason is returned to the client for debugging
- **Pre-flight config check**: Test script validates Sabre API connectivity before running all 30 routes
- **Advanced booking logging**: Every PNR creation attempt logs environment, baseURL, PCC, passenger passport data, each segment, and exact Sabre API errors

### Fixed
- **Pre-booking seat map SOAP fallback**: `/seats-rest` endpoint now automatically falls back to SOAP `EnhancedSeatMapRQ` when no PNR exists (was returning `success: false`)
- **Sabre production URL enforcement**: Config now resolves `environment` to `'production'` when prod credentials are detected, ensuring `api.platform.sabre.com` (not cert) is used
- **Airline PNR extraction enhanced**: 4-method deep extraction from GetBooking response (vendorLocators → airBooking segments → ReservationItems → JSON deep scan) ensures GDS PNR ≠ Airline PNR
- **Round-trip segment merging**: Outbound + return legs properly merged into single Sabre PNR
- **Multi-city segment flattening**: Nested leg structures recursively flattened before Sabre submission

### Production Sabre Endpoints (Confirmed)
| Service | Endpoint |
|---------|----------|
| Auth | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v3/auth/token` (OAuth v3 password grant) |
| Search | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v5/offers/shop` |
| Revalidate | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v4/shop/flights/revalidate` |
| Book | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v2.4.0/passenger/records?mode=create` |
| Cancel | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v1/trip/orders/cancelBooking` |
| Retrieve | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v1/trip/orders/getBooking` |
| Ticket | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v1.3.0/air/ticket` |
| Ticket Status | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v1/trip/orders/checkFlightTickets` |
| Seats (REST) | `https://api.platform.sabre.com/v1/offers/getseats` |
| SOAP | `https://webservices.platform.sabre.com` |

### Dual PNR Standard
- **GDS PNR**: Sabre 6-character record locator (booking reference)
- **Airline PNR**: Vendor/airline confirmation number (for check-in)
- These are ALWAYS different — extracted separately via GetBooking after PNR creation

---

## [3.9.9.4] — 2026-03-13 — REST GetSeats Resilience + SOAP Fallback

### Fixed
- **`GET /flights/seats-rest` now tries both contracts**: Sabre REST v3 (`/v3/offers/getseats/byPnrLocator`) and v1 (`/v1/offers/getseats`) with multiple payload variants
- **PNR viewership restriction handling**: when Sabre returns `Viewership is restricted for the PNR` (code 700102), API now returns a clear hint instead of generic failure
- **Automatic SOAP fallback**: if REST variants fail, endpoint falls back to SOAP `EnhancedSeatMapRQ` and returns real seat rows when available

## [3.9.9] — 2026-03-13 — Full Sabre Endpoint Coverage & Ticketing Upgrade

### Added
- **Price revalidation** (`revalidatePrice()`): `/v4/shop/flights/revalidate` — verify fare hasn't changed between search and booking
- **Booking retrieval** (`getBooking()`): `/v1/trip/orders/getBooking` — retrieve full PNR details via REST
- **Ticket status check** (`checkTicketStatus()`): `/v1/trip/orders/checkFlightTickets` — verify ticket issuance status post-booking
- **REST seat map** (`getSeatsRest()`): `/v2/offers/getseats` — alternative to SOAP EnhancedSeatMapRQ, requires PNR
- **3-tier seat map fallback**: SOAP EnhancedSeatMapRQ → REST GetSeats → TTI

### Changed
- **Ticketing upgraded from v1.2.1 to v1.3.0**: `issueTicket()` now calls `/v1.3.0/air/ticket`

### New Routes
- `POST /flights/revalidate-price` (authenticated)
- `GET /flights/booking/:pnr` (authenticated)
- `GET /flights/ticket-status/:pnr` (authenticated)
- `GET /flights/seats-rest` (public)

---

## [3.9.7] — 2026-03-13 — Sabre PNR NamePrefix Fix & SOAP Seat Map Retry

### Fixed
- **Sabre PNR creation failing with 400 NamePrefix error**: Sabre's `CreatePassengerNameRecordRQ` schema rejects the `NamePrefix` property inside `PersonName`. Removed `NamePrefix` and appended title (e.g., MR, MRS) directly to `GivenName` field (e.g., `GivenName: "JOHN MR"`) — this is the Sabre-standard format
- **Retry logic enhanced**: Updated `shouldRetry` regex in `sabre-flights.js` to catch `PersonName`, `NamePrefix`, and `not allowed` validation errors, ensuring fallback booking attempts trigger correctly
- **Seat map intermittent failures on production**: SOAP `EnhancedSeatMapRQ` was returning `layout: null` due to stale/expired session tokens in the backend cache. Added automatic retry with session cache clearing in `sabre-soap.js` — on SOAP fault or `NotProcessed` status, clears cached token and retries once with a fresh session

### Verified
- PNR `JIUKMY` created successfully on production via full_payload variant (no fallback needed)
- Seat maps returning real available seats: AI (126), EK (276), SQ (159)

---

## [3.9.6] — 2026-03-13 — TTI Cancellation Fix & NDC Investigation

### Fixed
- **TTI cancellation using wrong ID**: `cancelBooking()` was sending the internal TTI booking ID (e.g., `STTTI-xxx`) to the `Cancel` API method, which requires the **airline PNR** (e.g., `S2240313001234`). Probe matrix of 6 payload combinations identified that `{ BookingID: airlinePNR }` is the correct shape. Backend now extracts the airline PNR from `booking.details.gdsResponse` fields (`RecordLocator`, `BookingReference`, `PNR`, `ETTicketFares[0].Ref`) and falls back to `ttiBookingId`
- **Sabre SOAP cancel fallback**: Fixed missing `getSabreConfig` import in `sabre-soap.js` (was using undefined variable), added `cancelPnrViaSoap` to module exports

### Investigated
- **NDC fares not appearing**: BFM v5 request correctly includes `DataSources: { NDC: "Enable", ATPCO: "Enable", LCC: "Enable" }`, but Sabre confirmed NDC content requires PCC-level entitlements. PCC `J4YL` does not have NDC enabled — no code changes needed, Sabre account manager must activate NDC carrier agreements on the PCC

---

## [3.9.3] — 2026-03-12 — Sabre DOCS Schema Fix for PNR Creation

### Fixed
- **Sabre CreatePNR validation error**: Removed unsupported fields (`DateOfBirth`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Gender`) from `AdvancePassenger.Document` in `CreatePassengerNameRecordRQ`
- **DOCS payload hardening**: `AdvancePassenger.Document` now sends schema-safe passport fields only (`Type`, `Number`, `IssueCountry`, `NationalityCountry`, optional `ExpirationDate`)
- **PNR pipeline stability**: Prevents Sabre NotProcessed responses caused by invalid DOCS object shape, allowing proper PNR creation flow

---

## [3.9.2] — 2026-03-12 — Sabre PNR DateTime Schema Fix

### Fixed
- **Sabre CreatePNR NotProcessed**: `EnhancedAirBookRQ` segment datetimes were sent with timezone offsets (e.g., `2026-04-15T21:55:00+06:00`), which violates Sabre schema validation
- **DateTime normalization**: Added `toSabreDateTime()` in `sabre-flights.js` to convert segment datetimes into schema-safe values without timezone suffix before CreatePassengerNameRecordRQ submission
- **Flight segment normalization**: Hardened numeric flight number extraction and party size fallback to prevent malformed segment payloads

---

## [3.9.1] — 2026-03-12 — Sabre Compressed Response Fix

### Fixed
- **Sabre BFM returning 0 flights**: Sabre's `CompressResponse: true` flag caused the API to return a `compressedResponse` (base64 gzip blob) instead of plain JSON. The normalizer didn't handle this, resulting in 0 flights for all searches
- **Removed `CompressResponse`**: Disabled compressed response in BFM request body so Sabre returns plain `groupedItineraryResponse`
- **Added gzip decompression fallback**: If Sabre still returns `compressedResponse`, the backend now decompresses it via `zlib.gunzipSync` before normalization

---

## [3.9.0] — 2026-03-12 — Auto-Ticketing, API-Only Deadlines & Post-Booking Ancillaries

### Changed
- **Pay Later deadlines**: Removed all hardcoded fallback calculations (48h domestic / 7d international). Payment deadlines now come exclusively from the airline's GDS `timeLimit` / `LastTicketingDate`. If no deadline is provided by the API, the booking stays open until the airline auto-cancels the PNR
- **Frontend `resolveDeadlineInfo`**: Simplified to only use `flight.timeLimit` — no departure-based fallback logic
- **Backend `resolvePaymentDeadline`**: Now takes only `airlineTimeLimit` parameter, returns `null` if no GDS deadline

### Added
- **Auto-ticketing on payment**: Created `backend/src/services/auto-ticket.js` — when payment is confirmed via SSLCommerz, bKash, or Nagad, the system automatically:
  - Issues real GDS tickets via Sabre `issueTicket` or BDFare `issueTicket` APIs
  - For TTI/Air Astra: creates a `pending_issue` ticket record (manual ticketing by admin)
  - For international flights: checks passport/visa uploads before issuing tickets; defers ticketing if docs missing
  - Updates booking status to `ticketed` (if GDS succeeded) or `confirmed` (if manual needed)
- **SSLCommerz IPN auto-ticket**: Replaced manual ticket generation with `autoTicketAfterPayment()` call
- **bKash callback auto-ticket**: Replaced simple status update with `autoTicketAfterPayment()` call
- **Nagad callback auto-ticket**: Replaced simple status update with `autoTicketAfterPayment()` call
- **Post-booking ancillaries page**: New `PostBookingExtras` dashboard page at `/dashboard/bookings/:id/extras` — fetches real Sabre GAO (GetAncillaryOffersRQ) meal and baggage offers using the booking's PNR
- **Dashboard "Buy Extras" action**: Confirmed/Ticketed flight bookings with a PNR now show a "Buy Extras (Meals/Baggage)" dropdown action
- **Backend ancillary endpoint**: `GET /dashboard/bookings/:id/ancillaries` — loads PNR from booking, calls Sabre SOAP GAO in stateful mode, returns purchasable meals and baggage

### Security
- International flight auto-ticketing is gated behind document verification — tickets are NOT issued until passport uploads are confirmed

---

## [3.8.0] — 2026-03-12 — Animated Flight Timeline

### Enhanced
- **Flight timeline airplane animation**: Compact card now shows a glowing teal plane gliding along a gradient dashed track with accent-themed origin/destination dots and ring indicators
- **Expanded detail arc animation**: Plane traces the curved arc path with pulsing origin/destination dots, soft glow trail, and animated dashed stroke using SVG gradients
- **CSS keyframe `flight-dash`**: Smooth infinite scrolling dash pattern on the compact flight track

---

## [3.7.9] — 2026-03-12 — Branded Fares & Dedup Fix

### Added
- **Sabre branded fares**: BFM request now includes `DiversityParameters` and `CompressResponse` for richer fare options. Normalizer extracts brand names (e.g., "Economy Light", "Economy Smart") from `fareComponentDescs` and maps per-brand baggage, refund, rebooking, and cancellation policies
- **Fare Options panel brand labels**: Shows real brand names from GDS instead of generic "Fare Option 1/2". Each branded fare shows its own baggage, meal, seat selection, and policy data with "Best Value" badge on cheapest

### Fixed
- **Round-trip combinations collapsed to 1 result**: Backend dedup key now includes ALL leg flight numbers, arrival time, direction, and per-leg departure times — preserving every unique outbound+return combination
- **Fare options "Best Value" badge**: Now uses API-driven `isBestValue` flag instead of array index

### Notes
- **NDC fares**: `NDC: 'Enable'` is set in BFM request, but NDC content requires active airline NDC agreements on your Sabre PCC (J4YL). Contact Sabre to enable NDC carrier content for your agency
- **Base fare differences vs BDFare**: BDFare shows net/agent fares; Sabre shows published fares. Different commission models explain price differences on the same flight

---

## [3.7.8] — 2026-03-12 — Round-Trip Deduplication Fix

### Fixed
- **Round-trip combinations collapsed to 1 result**: Backend deduplication key only used first-leg flight number + departure time, causing all round-trip combos sharing the same outbound to be treated as duplicates. Now includes ALL leg flight numbers, arrival time, direction, and per-leg departure times — preserving every unique outbound+return combination (matching BDFare's 731 results vs our previous 1)

---

## [3.7.7] — 2026-03-12 — BDFare Normalizer Rewrite & Carrier Filter Fix

### Fixed
- **BDFare results not appearing**: Rewrote `normalizeBDFareResponse` to match actual BDFare API v2 response structure (`Response.Results[]`, `segments[].Airline`, `segments[].Origin/Destination`, `Fares[].BaseFare/Tax/Currency/PassengerCount`)
- **Preferred airline filter not working**: Search widget's airline dropdown (`carrier` param) was not passed to backend — now extracted from query params and applied as post-aggregation IATA code filter
- **Cabin class always showing Economy**: BDFare `productClass` and Sabre cabin codes now correctly mapped to display labels; UI shows real API cabin class instead of defaulting to Economy

### Changed
- **BDFare date/duration parsing**: Added robust parsers for BDFare-specific formats (`"02 Apr, Thu"` → ISO date, `"17h 50m"` → minutes)
- **Flight search route**: Added `carrier` query parameter support with case-insensitive airline code filtering across all providers
- **FlightResults.tsx**: Extracts `carrier` from URL search params and passes to backend API call

---

## [3.7.6] — 2026-03-12 — Multi-City Detail Parity & Airline Filter Bar

### Fixed
- **Multi-city airline filter bar**: Was hidden for multi-city results (`!isMultiCity` condition) — removed exclusion so airline carousel now appears for all trip types
- **Multi-city Flight Details panel**: Replaced minimal detail view with full system matching one-way/round-trip cards:
  - **Flight Details tab**: Full airport names, arc timeline visualization, "Change of planes" layover badges, seats left, aircraft type, cabin class display
  - **Fare Summary tab**: Full table with Pax Type, Base Fare, Tax, Other, Discount, AIT VAT, Pax Count, Amount columns + Total Payable
  - **Baggage tab**: Sector/Checkin/Cabin table per segment
  - **Cancellation tab**: Sector-based tables with timeframe and fee info + important disclaimer
  - **Date Change tab**: Added (was missing), sector-based tables matching other trip types

---

## [3.7.5] — 2026-03-12 — Multi-City Combined Search & UI Fixes

### Fixed
- **Multi-city Flight Details**: "Flight Details" button on multi-city cards was non-functional — added `MultiCityExpandedDetails` component with 4 tabs (Flight Details, Fare Summary, Baggage, Cancellation)

### Changed
- **Dark mode softened**: Replaced pure black backgrounds (`6% lightness`) with softer dark grays (`14% lightness`) across background, card, popover, muted, border, input, and sidebar tokens
- **Multi-city search architecture**: Changed from per-segment parallel searches to single Sabre BFM request with all `OriginDestinationInformation` entries — returns combined itineraries priced as one unit (matching BDFare behavior)
- **Multi-city flight cards**: Now display all segments in a single card with combined pricing instead of per-segment selection mode
- **Backend normalizer**: Multi-city results emit `isMultiCity: true` with `segments[]` array containing per-leg details

---

## [3.7.3] — 2026-03-12 — White Search Bar Redesign

### Changed
- **Search modification bar**: Redesigned from dark (`bg-foreground`) to white/light (`bg-card`) with muted chip backgrounds, primary-colored icons, and larger text/padding for better readability
- **Search chips**: Increased padding, font size (`text-xs` → `text-sm`), and icon sizes for improved touch targets and visibility

---

## [3.7.2] — 2026-03-12 — Reward Points System, Flight Card Enhancements & Responsiveness

### Added — Reward Points System
- **Backend**: `backend/src/routes/rewards.js` — balance, history, coupons, redeem (points→coupon), validate/apply coupon at checkout, earn-rate endpoint
- **Database**: `backend/database/reward-points-migration.sql` — `user_points`, `point_transactions`, `reward_coupons`, `points_rules` tables (all using `CHAR(36)` FKs for UUID compatibility)
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/rewards` page — points balance card, redeem form, coupon list, transaction history
- **Flight cards**: 🪙 reward points badge showing estimated earn (1% of fare)
- **Flight card info row**: BDFare-style baggage (hand/checked), available seats, fare class (e.g., Class: Q)

### Fixed
- **502 crash**: `rewards.js` imported `authenticateToken` (undefined) — fixed to `authenticate`
- **Migration FK error 3780**: rewards tables used `INT` user_id but `users.id` is `CHAR(36)` UUID — fixed
- **Flight card overflow**: round-trip cards overflowed on 1024–1280px screens — reduced airline column (`sm:w-36 lg:w-40`), price column (`sm:w-40 lg:w-48`), added `min-w-0` overflow prevention, scaled LegMini fonts
- **Round-trip price filter**: slider used per-direction prices while filter checked total round-trip prices — now both use `roundTripPairs.totalPrice`

---

## [3.7.0] — 2026-03-12 — Zero-Mock Enforcement: 100% API-Driven Ancillaries & Seat Maps

### Changed — Complete Mock Data Elimination
- **Seat Map**: Removed `generateSeatLayout()` mock function (random 30% occupancy, hardcoded prices ₹300-800). SeatMap component now exclusively renders real data from Sabre SOAP `EnhancedSeatMapRQ` or TTI `GetSeatMap`. If no real data available, shows "Seat Selection Not Available" with airline check-in guidance.
- **Extra Baggage**: Removed `STANDARD_BAGGAGE` hardcoded array (8 fake options). Ancillaries endpoint returns empty array when Sabre SOAP and TTI APIs don't provide baggage data.
- **Meal Options**: Removed `STANDARD_MEALS` hardcoded array (9 fake meals). Same zero-mock enforcement — empty when no API data.
- **Baggage Display**: Removed all "As per airline policy" fallback text. If GDS doesn't return baggage allowance, UI now shows "Not provided by airline booking system" or hides the field entirely.
- **Backend `ancillaries.js`**: Complete rewrite — removed all fallback arrays, `generateSeatLayout()`, and domestic price adjustment on mock data.
- **Frontend `SeatMap.tsx`**: Complete rewrite — accepts real API data via props (`seatMapData`, `seatMapSource`, `seatMapLoading`), parses rows/columns/occupancy from Sabre SOAP XML-parsed response.
- **Source badges**: Show "Live Sabre Data" or "Live Airline Data" only when real data is present.

### Technical
- Backend seat-map endpoint returns `{ available: false }` when no real seat map exists (no generated fallback)
- Backend ancillaries endpoint returns `{ source: 'none', meals: [], baggage: [] }` when no real API provides data
- `includedBaggage.checked` returns `null` instead of "As per airline policy" when search API didn't provide baggage data
- Frontend SeatMap hooks restructured to comply with React Rules of Hooks (all hooks before conditional returns)

---

## [3.6.0] — 2026-03-12 — Deferred Document Verification & MRZ Auto-Validation

### Changed — International Flight Document Upload Flow (Major Rearchitecture)
- **Before**: Passport and visa copies were required during booking (Step 2/4), blocking the entire flow
- **After**: Users can complete booking freely without uploading documents
- **Document upload moved to Dashboard**: When users click "Pay Now" on an international flight booking (Reserved/On Hold), the `TravelDocVerificationModal` opens
- **MRZ Auto-Verification**: Passport uploads are automatically processed through OCR (Google Vision) to extract Machine Readable Zone data
- **Auto-Correction**: If MRZ data differs from passenger info (name, passport number, expiry, DOB, gender, nationality), the system automatically corrects passenger data from passport (trusted ICAO 9303 source)
- **Verification Results**: Shows confidence percentage, lists all corrected fields with old→new values
- **Gate Logic**: International flights require all passport + visa copies uploaded before proceeding to payment; domestic flights go straight to payment
- Review step shows an info banner explaining the document requirement for ticketing
- New component: `TravelDocVerificationModal.tsx`



## [3.5.1] — 2026-03-12 — Flight Search Route Validation Hardening

### Fixed — International Scope Allowing Domestic Routes After Swap
- **Bug**: Selecting International scope, then swapping airports (e.g., DAC→BOM becomes BOM→DAC, then changing FROM back to CXB) allowed domestic BD→BD routes to persist under International scope
- **Root cause**: Swap function blindly swapped without re-validating against scope rules; FROM change didn't re-validate existing TO selection
- **Fix**: Introduced centralized `isScopeInvalidRoute()` and `getScopedDestinationAirports()` validators used across all paths:
  - Swap button now blocks invalid swaps with toast error
  - FROM/TO useEffect auto-clears TO when route becomes invalid
  - Multi-city segment updates auto-clear TO on invalid FROM change
  - Search submit validates all segments (single + multi-city) before navigation

### Changed — Multi-City Segment Validation
- `updateSegment()` now checks destination validity when FROM changes mid-segment
- Multi-city search submit validates every segment against scope rules before navigating

---

## [3.5.0] — 2026-03-12 — Sabre SOAP Integration & Enterprise Booking Flow

### Added — Sabre SOAP Session Manager (`backend/src/routes/sabre-soap.js`)
- **SessionCreateRQ**: Creates and caches BinarySecurityToken (14-minute TTL) using Sabre PROD credentials
- **EnhancedSeatMapRQ (v6.0.0)**: Real-time seat map with row/column parsing, availability, exit rows, aisle detection, and per-seat pricing
- **GetAncillaryOffersRQ (v3.0.0)**: Queries paid baggage (GroupCode BG) and meal offers (GroupCode ML), categorized and priced
- **SessionCloseRQ**: Proper session termination and cache invalidation
- Session caching prevents redundant SOAP calls within 14-minute window

### Added — Enterprise Special Services (SSR) System
- 16 meal type codes (AVML, VGML, MOML, KSML, DBML, CHML, BBML, GFML, LFML, LCML, NLML, SFML, FPML, RVML, SPML + No Preference)
- 3 wheelchair levels (WCHR, WCHS, WCHC) per IATA standard
- Medical assistance (MEDA), blind (BLND), deaf (DEAF) toggles
- Unaccompanied minor (UMNR) for child passengers with age input
- Pet transport: in-cabin (PETC) or cargo hold (AVIH) with details
- Frequent flyer number input (airline code + FF number)
- Destination address (DOCA) for international immigration
- Free-text special request (OSI) up to 70 characters
- All SSR per-passenger — each traveler gets independent SSR selections
- SSR data injected into REST PNR `CreatePassengerNameRecordRQ` at booking time

### Added — 4-Step Mandatory Booking Flow
- **Step 1: Flight Details** — Itinerary summary with segment cards
- **Step 2: Passenger Info + Special Services** — Traveler forms with SSR card (expandable per-passenger accordion)
- **Step 3: Seat & Extras** — SOAP-powered interactive seat map + tabbed extra baggage/meal purchase
- **Step 4: Review & Pay** — Full summary of itinerary, passengers, selected seats, extras, SSR, and fare breakdown
- Stepper always shows all 4 steps with icons (Plane, Users, Armchair, CreditCard)

### Added — Interactive Seat Map Component (`src/components/flights/SeatMap.tsx`)
- Aircraft-aware layout generation (narrowbody 3-3, widebody 3-3-3, ATR/Dash 2-2)
- Per-passenger seat selection with auto-advance to next unassigned passenger
- Seat type color coding: standard, window, aisle, exit row, extra legroom, front row, premium
- Tooltip with seat details and pricing
- Selected seats summary with per-passenger breakdown and total cost
- Seat cost integrated into fare sidebar grand total

### Changed — Ancillaries Priority Chain (`backend/src/routes/ancillaries.js`)
- Priority: Sabre SOAP → TTI (Air Astra/S2) → Standard in-memory fallback
- Seat map endpoint: Sabre SOAP → TTI → Aircraft-based layout generator
- Frontend no longer filters out "standard" source — shows all available data

### Fixed — Critical Variable Ordering Bug
- `paxTypes` was referenced in `useState` initializer before its declaration (temporal dead zone)
- Moved `searchParams`, `paxTypes`, `passengers` declarations before any state that depends on them
- This bug caused the entire booking component to crash, hiding steps 3-4

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-03-11 — Multi-Provider Flight Engine & OCR v7

---



### Fixed — Flight Booking Tax Calculation
- **Taxes now use real GDS data**: `outboundFlight.taxes` and `returnFlight.taxes` from TTI/BDFare/FlyHub/Sabre responses are used directly instead of a hardcoded 12% calculation
- **Service charge**: Now reads from flight object (`outboundFlight.serviceCharge`) with `0` fallback instead of hardcoded `৳250`
- Base fare calculation uses `baseFare` field from GDS when available, falling back to `price` field

### Fixed — Backend Admin Settings
- **Markup config**: Admin Settings PUT endpoint now properly handles `markup_config` JSON persistence to `system_settings` table
- **Currency rates**: Admin Settings PUT endpoint now properly handles `currency_rates` JSON persistence
- **Settings GET response**: Now returns parsed `markup_config` and `currency_rates` in the `settings` object instead of raw strings
- **Invoice payment reminders**: `POST /admin/invoices/:id/remind` now sends real email notification via the notification service instead of returning a placeholder response

### Removed — Dead Code (Zero-Mock Policy)
- Removed `defaultDiscounts` array (7 hardcoded discount entries) from `AdminDiscounts.tsx` — data is fetched from `/admin/discounts` API
- Removed `defaultPriceRules` array (7 hardcoded price rule entries) from `AdminDiscounts.tsx`
- Added `PAY_LATER` to `PAYMENT_METHODS` constant for completeness

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with v3.2 audit status, Sabre GDS in integrations table, markup/currency admin modules, corrected domain references
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with full v3.2 changes

---

## [3.1.0] — 2026-03-10 — Enterprise Booking Management & Full Audit

### Added — Admin Booking Lifecycle
- **Archive Booking** (`PATCH /admin/bookings/:id/archive`): Soft-archive bookings to hide from all dashboards while preserving DB records
- **Delete Booking** (`DELETE /admin/bookings/:id`): Permanently delete bookings with related tickets and transactions, with confirmation dialog
- Archive/delete options added to admin booking dropdown menu with destructive action confirmation
- Archived bookings are excluded from all dashboard stats, counts, and listing queries (admin + customer)

### Fixed — Status Filter Tabs
- Customer dashboard booking tabs ("On Hold", "In Progress", "Un-Confirmed") now correctly map to backend snake_case format (`on_hold`, `in_progress`, `un_confirmed`)

### Fixed — E-Ticket PDF
- Logo aspect ratio preserved (no longer stretched/squished) using dynamic `getImageProperties` sizing
- 4-column flight segment layout with full details: Aircraft, Terminal, Baggage, Meals, Distance, CO2 emissions
- Robust TTI date parsing (`/Date(ms+offset)/` format) preventing "Invalid Date" errors

### Fixed — Archived Booking Filtering
- All 8 booking-related SQL queries now filter `(archived IS NULL OR archived = 0)`:
  - Admin: dashboard stats, bookings list, recent bookings, bookings by type
  - Customer: dashboard stats, upcoming trips, booking breakdown, recent bookings, booking list

---

## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-10 — Complete Platform Audit v2 & Production Finalization

### Fixed — Booking Flows Now Call Real APIs
- **eSIM Purchase**: Now calls `POST /esim/purchase` instead of just navigating to confirmation
- **Holiday Booking**: Now calls `POST /holidays/book` with package details and returns bookingRef
- **Medical Booking**: Now calls `POST /medical/book` with hospital and form data
- **Car Booking**: Now calls `POST /cars/book` with car, dates, and form data
- All 4 booking flows now persist bookings in the database and return real booking references

### Fixed — Hardcoded Data Removal (Zero-Mock Policy v2)
- **BookingConfirmation**: Removed hardcoded fallbacks for route (`"Dhaka → Cox's Bazar"`), flightNo (`"BG-435"`), departTime (`"07:30"`), arriveTime (`"08:35"`), stops (`"Non-stop"`), and ticketNo (random `997-xxx`)
- **AdminCurrency**: Removed 5 hardcoded default exchange rates — now shows empty state when no rates configured
- **ESIMPlans**: Removed 4 hardcoded fallback country filters — now uses CMS data only
- **MedicalServices**: Removed 5+6 hardcoded country/treatment fallback arrays
- **HolidayPackages**: Removed 5+4 hardcoded includes/filter fallback arrays

## [2.5.0] — 2026-03-09 — TTI/ZENITH GDS Integration & Database-Backed Config

### Added — TTI/ZENITH Air Astra Flight API
- **Real-time GDS flight search** via TTI/ZENITH Reservation System (Agency ID 10000240)
- **Backend proxy** (`backend/src/routes/tti-flights.js`) — calls TTI `SearchFlights`, normalizes WCF JSON responses into standard format
- **Parallel data merge** — Local DB flights + TTI API results combined in `flights.js`
- **Google Flights-style UI** — Completely redesigned `FlightResults.tsx` with compact cards, airline logos (40+ airlines mapped), timeline segments, layover badges, and expandable detail panels
- **Advanced flight filters** — Stops (Non-stop / 1 / 2+), price range slider, departure time range, airline checkboxes, sort by price/duration/departure

### Changed — Database-Backed API Configuration (Security Hardening)
- **All API keys moved from `.env` to database** — `system_settings` table stores encrypted configs for TTI, payment gateways, SMS, email, OAuth
- **TTI reads from DB** with 5-minute cache (`getTTIConfig()`) — no env vars needed
- **Admin Settings** — New "Air Astra TTI/ZENITH (Flight GDS)" card in API Integrations tab with URL, key, and agency ID fields
- **Config cache invalidation** — `clearTTIConfigCache()` called when admin saves TTI settings

### Changed — AdminDiscounts Migrated to API
- **Discounts & Price Rules** — Migrated from localStorage to backend API (`GET/PUT /admin/discounts`)
- Added `discounts` and `price_rules` keys in `system_settings` table
- Full CRUD via React Query mutations with optimistic cache invalidation

---

## [2.4.0] — 2026-03-09 — Complete Data Flow Audit & Mandatory Validations

### Fixed — Search Validation (ALL services now require dates)
- **Holiday Search** — Now requires travel date before searching. Shows toast error if missing.
- **Visa Search** — Now requires both travel date AND return date. Shows toast error if missing.
- **Medical Search** — Now requires travel date for appointment. Shows toast error if missing.
- **eSIM Search** — Now requires activation date. Shows toast error if missing.
- **Recharge** — Now validates operator, phone number, and amount before navigating.
- **Pay Bill** — Now validates category, biller, account number, and amount before navigating.

### Fixed — Results Pages (ALL read URL params + show "No Criteria" guard)
- **HolidayPackages** — Now reads `destination` and `date` from URL. Shows "No Search Criteria" empty state when params missing. Displays destination and date in hero.
- **CarRental** — Now reads `pickupDate` and `dropoffDate` from URL. Shows "No Search Criteria" when dates missing. Passes dates to API. Book buttons include date params in link.
- **MedicalServices** — Now reads `country`, `treatment`, and `date` from URL. Shows "No Search Criteria" when date missing. Passes date to enquiry links.
- **ESIMPlans** — Now reads `country` and `activation` from URL. Shows "No Search Criteria" when activation date missing. Passes activation date to purchase links.
- **VisaServices** — Now reads `country`, `type`, `date`, `return`, and `travellers` from URL. Shows "No Search Criteria" when travel date missing. Passes all params to Apply Now links. Filters countries by URL country if provided.

### Fixed — Data Flow Continuity
- All search handlers in SearchWidget now pass dates in URL params.
- All results pages now read those dates and pass them to the API.
- All "Book Now" / "Apply Now" / "Enquire" buttons pass full context (dates, IDs, locations) to booking pages.
- Booking pages pass complete data to BookingConfirmation via `location.state`.

---

## [2.3.0] — 2026-03-09 — Critical Logic Fixes & Enterprise Flight Cards

### Fixed
- **Mandatory Date Validation** — Flight departure date, hotel check-in/check-out, car pickup/drop-off dates now required before search. Toast errors shown for missing dates. Round-trip requires return date.
- **Hotel Search Param Mismatch** — SearchWidget sends `destination`, HotelResults now reads both `destination` and `location` params correctly.
- **Hotel Results Guard** — Shows "No Search Criteria" empty state when no check-in/check-out dates provided instead of empty list.
- **FlightBooking Hardcoded Data** — Was showing static "07:30 DAC → 08:35 CXB". Now fetches actual flight details via `useFlightDetails(flightId)` and displays real data.
- **Booking Confirmation Data** — FlightBooking, HotelDetail, HolidayDetail, CarBooking, MedicalBooking, and ESIMPurchase now ALL pass complete booking data (route, price, taxes, totals, type) via `location.state` to the confirmation page.
- **CarBooking Hardcoded Data** — Was showing static "Toyota Corolla — Sedan". Now reads car ID from URL params.
- **BookingConfirmation Dynamic Icons** — Shows correct service icon (Plane/Building2/Car/Stethoscope/Smartphone/Globe) based on booking type instead of always showing Plane.
- **HotelDetail Book Now** — Passes hotel name, room price, and calculated taxes to confirmation page.
- **HolidayDetail Book Package** — Passes package destination, price, and taxes to confirmation page.

### Added
- **Enterprise-grade Flight Result Cards** — Airline logo mapping for 15+ airlines (Biman, US-Bangla, Novoair, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, etc.), proper time formatting, clock icons, gradient flight path lines, refundable badges, price range filtering.
- **FlightResults "No Criteria" Guard** — Shows empty state when required params (from, to, depart) are missing.

### Refactored
- **FlightResults.tsx** — Extracted `FlightCard` and `FilterPanel` into separate components for maintainability.
- **SearchWidget** — Added `sonner` toast import for validation feedback.

- ✅ All 10 service pages (Flights, Hotels, Holidays, Visa, Medical, Cars, eSIM, Recharge, PayBill, Contact)
- ✅ All 8 static pages (About, Blog, BlogPost, FAQ, Careers, Terms, Privacy, Refund Policy)
- ✅ All 4 auth pages (Login, Register, ForgotPassword, VerifyOTP with 6-digit input)
- ✅ All 12 user dashboard pages (Overview, Bookings, E-Tickets, Transactions, E-Transactions, Payments, Invoices, Pay Later, Travellers, Wishlist, Search History, Settings)
- ✅ All 17 admin modules (Dashboard, Bookings, Users, Payments, Payment Approvals, Discounts, Invoices, Reports, Visa, CMS suite, Settings)
- ✅ Header (responsive, transparent-on-home, user dropdown, mobile sheet)

### Fixed (This Release)
- **DashboardETransactions** — Fixed field mapping: backend returns `method`/`fee`/`date`, UI expected `entryType`/`gatewayFee`/`createdOn`. Now auto-normalizes both formats
- **DashboardSearchHistory** — Fixed missing `summary` and `resultsCount` fields: auto-generates summary from `origin → destination` when not present
- **DashboardPayLater** — Fixed data key priority: now reads `data` first (backend standard), falls back to `items`; formats due dates
- **DashboardHome pie chart** — Fixed: backend returns raw counts, now auto-converts to percentage for the donut chart
- **Newsletter subscribe** — Added backend route `POST /contact/subscribe` (was 404)
- **Booking confirmation email** — Added backend route `POST /dashboard/bookings/send-confirmation`

### Backend Routes Added
- `POST /contact/subscribe` — Newsletter email subscription
- `POST /dashboard/bookings/send-confirmation` — Email booking confirmation to user

## [2.1.0] — 2026-03-08 — API Response Alignment & Zero Mock Data

### Critical Fixes
- **All listing pages (Flights, Hotels, Holidays, eSIM, Cars, Medical, Recharge, PayBill)** — Fixed API response shape mismatch: frontend expected `.flights`, `.hotels`, `.packages` etc. but backend returns `.data`. All pages now correctly read `apiData.data || apiData.flights || []`
- **Admin Dashboard** — Mapped backend flat response (`totalUsers`, `totalBookings`, `totalRevenue`) to UI `stats[]` array format
- **User Dashboard** — Fixed `.bookings`, `.transactions`, `.travellers`, `.tickets`, `.wishlist`, `.invoices`, `.payments` to fallback to `.data`
- **Backend: SQL GROUP BY** — Fixed `only_full_group_by` error in `admin.js` and `dashboard.js` monthly revenue queries
- **Backend: JSON.parse crashes** — Created `safeJsonParse()` utility; applied across `hotels.js`, `services.js` for all JSON columns (images, amenities, features, specialties, etc.)
- **eSIM Plans** — Fixed `plan.data` → `plan.dataAmount` field name mismatch
- **AdminVisa** — Removed last `mockAdminVisa` import; now fully API-driven

### Removed
- All mock data imports removed from entire codebase (`mock-data.ts` no longer imported anywhere)

### Performance
- Server warm-up on first visitor load (parallel `/health` + CMS prefetch)
- Route prefetching on nav link hover via `requestIdleCallback`
- CSS `content-visibility: auto` on images/video, `optimizeSpeed` text rendering

- **Admin Panel: SMS & Email Config** — Admin → Settings → API Integrations → Communication tab (BulkSMSBD + Resend API keys)
